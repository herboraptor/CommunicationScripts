Notes: exclusion scripts are used with the 'or' operator to consider each script independently (i.e. an email will not send if the one of three scripts are met), or with the 'and' operator to consider all scripts collectively.

/*script to exclude recipients where the last digit of the field name 'DEField' from the Data Extension associated with the trigger/user-initiated send is equal to 0 or 1*/

Substring(DEField, SUBTRACT(Length(DEField), 0), 1) == '0'
